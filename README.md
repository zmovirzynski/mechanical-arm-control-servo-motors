# mechanical-arm-control-servo-motors

This repository contains code for controlling a mechanical arm using servo motors, written in C++ for Arduino. The project demonstrates how to manage multiple servos to perform smooth and precise movements, including controlling a robotic gripper (claw).

## Project Structure

Main.ino: The main file that initializes and controls the movement of the mechanical arm's servos.
ServoControl.h: Header file declaring functions for controlling the arm's claw.
ServoControl.cpp: Implementation file containing the logic for the claw's movement.

## Features

Smooth movement control for the mechanical arm.
Functionality to open and close a robotic claw.
Modularized code for easy maintenance and expansion.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Main.ino file in the Arduino IDE.
3. Upload the code to your Arduino board.
4. Connect your servos to the appropriate pins as defined in the code.
5. Power on the system to see the arm in action.
